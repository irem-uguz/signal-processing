%% CHANGE THE PITCH

%% EXERCISE I
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   Re-arrange the data so that   %
%   the frequency is quadrupled and play the file   %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
pause(duration + 2)
sound(y(1:4:end),Fs);
                            
                                                
                              
%% EXERCISE II
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   Re-arrange the data so that   %
%   the frequency is halved and play the file  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
pause(duration + 2)
sound(y(1:0.5:end),Fs);                            
                                                
                                                
%% EXERCISE III 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   Double Fs and play the sound  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

pause(duration * 2)
sound(y,Fs*2);

%% EXERCISE IV
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   Divide Fs by two and play the sound  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
